#Kodiak - a personal photo blog/sharing tool

Todo:
- Drag and drop image loading, this should also add the new images to
  the current rst
- Handle static page publishing (should we auto generate or require a
  publish button?) - How to indicate staleness?
- Resize thumbnails on preview page instead of using full images
- Clicking on an image in preview should bring it up in a lightbox full
  screen and display the alt text. Users should be able to use arrows to
  view the new and previous images for all other images on the page.
- flask-user-login
- Pages Index
- Public/Private/Limited
- Style and correctly handle meta data
- Facebook/twitter microtags
- RSS feed (multiple, public, limited, all)
